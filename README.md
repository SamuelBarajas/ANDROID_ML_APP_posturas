## üìÑ About

<p align='justify'>
This project is a cross-platform mobile application that uses a Python model (Google ML Kit API) to detect different parts of the body using the smartphone's camera. By analyzing the detected parts, the application calculates the angles between them to determine postural risk. The results are then displayed in a Kotlin-based mobile application, which allows users to view their body tracking data and analyze their posture. This project is a powerful tool for improving posture and reducing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders, making it an invaluable asset for anyone looking to maintain a healthy body and lifestyle.
